  conversation:
  - Hi Midnight! I found the book you were looking for, here you go!
  - "Alright, I\u2019ll go look for Mochi."
  answer:
  - Thank you so much Kitty! I am glad you were able to find it, oh and I also heard
    that Mochi needed some help too. She should not be too far from here, I would
    help her myself, but I am a bit busy.
