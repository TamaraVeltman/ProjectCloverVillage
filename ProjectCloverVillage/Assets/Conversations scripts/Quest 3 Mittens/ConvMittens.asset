  conversation:
  - Welcome back Kitty. I just read the letter
  - Oh my! It says there is a treasure buried somewhere in the village and there
    is a riddle in the letter as well. I think that if you can solve the riddle,
    you will be able to find the treasure.
  - "The riddle goes \u201CI am always open or closed, but never in between. I let
    you in, I keep you out.\u201D Good luck!"
  answer:
  - Hey. What did the letter say?
  - Oeh treasure hunting! Do tell!
  - I got this!!
