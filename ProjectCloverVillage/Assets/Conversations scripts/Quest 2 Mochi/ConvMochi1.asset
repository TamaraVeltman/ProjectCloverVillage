  - Hi Kitty!
  - "Yes I did, I want some candy from my house, but I don\u2019t feel good enough
    to go over there myself to look for my candy, could you maybe go over there for
    me and return some candy to me?"
  answer:
  - Hey Mochi, I heard you needed some help?
  - "Yes, I\u2019ll be back in a bit!"
